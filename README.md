## SU(3) Symmetry of Quarks
In this project the SU(3) transformation generators are studied.  
The 8 transformation generators are initialized as well as we as the three dimensional basis of quarks.   
The raising and lowering operators are created and their effect on the quarks is printed in the console. 

## Wavepacket animation
In this project the movement of a wave packet in a harmonic oscillator potential is studied.  
The probability density function is plotted for many different frames and the animated result of the wave packet's movement is saved in the folder. 

## Presentations
In this folder you will find short PowerPoint presentations about the two projects.
